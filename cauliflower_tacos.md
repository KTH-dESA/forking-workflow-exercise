# Cauliflower tacos

This recipe is taken as an example from https://github.com/sinker/tacofancy/blob/master/full_tacos/cauliflower_tacos.md.

We are avid meat eaters, but these vegetarian tacos are one of our go-tos in
Peru. If you can make the pickles with Peruvian aji amarillo, please do.

- 1 Roast cauliflower
- 1/2 Pickled chilis and vegetables
- 1 Caramelized red onions
- 200g Guacamole
- 125g Yogurt
- 6 Tortilla of choice, warmed in a dry pan
